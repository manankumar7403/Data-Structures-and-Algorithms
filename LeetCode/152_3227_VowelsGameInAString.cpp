// ðŸ”´ðŸ”´LEETCODE 3227 -> Vowels Game In A String (Contest 407)ðŸ”´ðŸ”´
/*
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a string.
You are given a string s, Alice and Bob will take turns playing the following game where Alice starts first:
On Alice's turn, she has to remove any non-empty substring from s that contains an odd number of vowels.
On Bob's turn, he has to remove any non-empty substring from s that contains an even number of vowels.
The first player who cannot make a move on their turn loses the game. We assume that both Alice and Bob play optimally.
Return true if Alice wins the game, and false otherwise.
The English vowels are: a, e, i, o, and u.

Example 1:
Input: s = "leetcoder"
Output: true
Explanation:
Alice can win the game as follows:
Alice plays first, she can delete the underlined substring in s = "leetcoder" which contains 3 vowels. The resulting string is
s = "der". Bob plays second, he can delete the underlined substring in s = "der" which contains 0 vowels. The resulting string
is s = "er". Alice plays third, she can delete the whole string s = "er" which contains 1 vowel.
Bob plays fourth, since the string is empty, there is no valid play for Bob. So Alice wins the game.

Example 2:
Input: s = "bbcd"
Output: false
Explanation:
There is no valid play for Alice in her first turn, so Alice loses the game.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
