## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/manankumar7403/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git
cd Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
```

2. Run C++ Code:
    - You can use VS Code with the Code Runner extension, as the repo is structured for that.

    - Alternatively, you can use:

        - OnlineGDB / Replit / GeeksforGeeks IDE

        - Or compile locally:
            ```bash
            g++ filename.cpp -o filename
            ./filename
            ```

3. Navigate to your topic of interest and run the .cpp file.
