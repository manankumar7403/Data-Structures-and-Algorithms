/*
Like Kruskalâ€™s algorithm, Primâ€™s algorithm is also a Greedy algorithm. This algorithm always starts with a single node and
moves through several adjacent nodes, in order to explore all of the connected edges along the way.
The algorithm starts with an empty spanning tree. The idea is to maintain two sets of vertices. The first set contains the
vertices already included in the MST, and the other set contains the vertices not yet included. At every step, it considers
all the edges that connect the two sets and picks the minimum weight edge from these edges. After picking the edge, it moves
the other endpoint of the edge to the set containing MST. 

A group of edges that connects two sets of vertices in a graph is called cut in graph theory. So, at every step of Primâ€™s
algorithm, find a cut, pick the minimum weight edge from the cut, and include this vertex in MST Set (the set that contains
already included vertices).

/*
Advantages:
Primâ€™s algorithm is guaranteed to find the MST in a connected, weighted graph.
It has a time complexity of O(E log V) using a binary heap or Fibonacci heap, where E is the number of edges and V is the
number of vertices.
It is a relatively simple algorithm to understand and implement compared to some other MST algorithms.

Disadvantages:
Like Kruskalâ€™s algorithm, Primâ€™s algorithm can be slow on dense graphs with many edges, as it requires iterating over all
edges at least once.
Primâ€™s algorithm relies on a priority queue, which can take up extra memory and slow down the algorithm on very large graphs.
The choice of starting node can affect the MST output, which may not be desirable in some applications
