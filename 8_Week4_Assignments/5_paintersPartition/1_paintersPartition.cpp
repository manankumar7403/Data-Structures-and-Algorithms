// ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ Painter's Partition Problem ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´

// Dilpreet wants to paint his dog's home that has n boards with different lengths. The length of ith board
// is given by arr[i] where arr[] is an array of n integers. He hired k painters for this work and each
// painter takes 1 unit time to paint 1 unit of the board.

// The problem is to find the minimum time to get this job done if all painters start together with the
// constraint that any painter will only paint continuous boards, say boards numbered {2,3,4} or only board
// {1} or nothing but not boards {2,4,5}.

// Example 1:
// Input:
// n = 5
// k = 3
// arr[] = {5,10,30,20,15}
// Output: 35
// Explanation: The most optimal way will be:
// Painter 1 allocation : {5,10}
// Painter 2 allocation : {30}
// Painter 3 allocation : {20,15}
// Job will be done when all painters finish i.e. at time = max(5+10, 30, 20+15) = 35

// Example 2:
// Input:
// n = 4
// k = 2
// arr[] = {10,20,30,40}
// Output: 60
// Explanation: The most optimal way to paint:
// Painter 1 allocation : {10,20,30}
// Painter 2 allocation : {40}
// Job will be complete at time = 60

// Expected Time Complexity: O(n log m) , m = sum of all boards' length
// Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

// Constraints:
// 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^5
// 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 10^5
// 1 â‰¤ arr[i] â‰¤ 10^5
